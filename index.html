	<h1> Plastic Pollution Survey on behalf of WPCO .</h1>
     <h3>
         8.3 billion plastics pollute the world's beaches. But only 1% of plastic ends up as sea waste. By 2020, the number of sea  plastics will exceed the number of fish

         What is the amount of plastic pollution in the world?
     </h2>
      <p>
         	Plastic pollution is a global problem that requires concerted action. We can look for plastic all around us - in our homes, schools, workplaces and even in our natural places. However, currently only 9% of the plastic is being recycled, the rest is within the land or environment. The chemical synthesis of plastic makes it completely indigestible, creating pollution and problems for our planet and human health. If we continue to use plastic at this rate, our planet will suffer.

          China contributes the highest share of unused plastic waste to about 26 percent of the world's total, followed by Indonesia at 10 percent, the Philippines and Vietnam.

     <h3>Ranking the Countries that Pollute the Oceans With the Most Plastics</h3>

     	         	81% of all ocean plastic comes from the continent of Asia. In Asia, there are many rivers that empty into the ocean. Due to poor waste management, plastic gets in the rivers and then eventually flows into the ocean. North America and Europe make up just 4.5% and 0.6% of the ocean plastic respectively. So while it’s still important to reduce plastic use in these areas, the plastic here is more likely to end up in landfills rather than the ocean.

                    Which countries are the worst offenders of plastic trash in the ocean? The following chart shows the Top 50 countries that are the worst offenders of plastic trash

     		The Philippines, an Asian island nation making up approximately 1% of the world’s population is responsible for a 36.4% of the world’s ocean plastic. 7 of the 10 rivers that funnel most plastic in the ocean are located in the Philippines. While more developed countries are likely to produce plastic per person, the trash is also more likely to end up in a landfill or be recycled or incinerated than in the Philippines. The top five countries producing the most ocean plastic are in Asia and together they make up 69.8% of the world’s plastic trash in oceans.

            The United States contributes just 0.2% of the world’s ocean plastic despite making up over 3% of the world’s population. Before congratulating ourselves too much, however, it’s worth noting that the United States is the highest per capita creator of plastic waste. However, our plastic waste does not end up in the ocean because most of the country is landlocked and most of our plastic ends up in landfills.

          Most of the countries that populate the above worst ocean plastics offenders list are developing nations with lower economic resources to put toward waste management. If you look at just more developed countries with the resources to prevent ocean pollution, which ones rank the worst? The chart below looks only at countries with the top 50 GDP per capita and ranks them by plastic ocean emissions
